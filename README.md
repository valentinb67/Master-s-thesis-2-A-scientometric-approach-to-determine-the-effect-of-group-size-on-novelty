The aim of this dissertation is to determine the degree of novelty of a scientific article based on methods for calculating rarity (Commonness) developed by Lee and al. [2015] and which is an extension of Uzzi et al. [2013] (Atypicality). 

This Commonness indicator will enable us to show the influence of group size on the ability to produce innovative results, based on the study by Lee et al. [2015]. We will also try to establish a link between the degree of novelty of a scientific production discussing the SDG's and the fact that it deals with digital technologies.

This project represents an opportunity for me to discover scientometrics using the Novelpy python package, developed by P. Pelletier and K. Wirtz, which calculates a multitude of novelty indicators from a database containing information specific to scientific publications. The next objective will be (hoping my hardware holds out) to continue by tackling more complex indicators, involving NLP methods, notably text Embedding (Shibayama et al. [2021]s indicators).
